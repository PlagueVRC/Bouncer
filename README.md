# Info
Bouncer is a VRChat mod to automatically moderate your lobbies. It can filter in numerous ways at once, and kick people who don't meet your filters. 

Example 1) if someone has been a nuisance before in your certain club / events, you can blacklist them and if you are hosting, it will kick them before they ever join. They will never get in while this mod is in use. This mod only works if you are instance / world owner.

Example 2) So, say you have ‘friends’ filter turned on, and a non-friend joins, they would be kicked. If you were to have the whitelist and friends filters on, and a whitelisted non friend joins, they would remain.

Supported filters:

Whitelist

Blacklist

Friends

Restricted Avatars (If a user spawns in with a disallowed avatar, they will be kicked, regardless of above filters. Detects avatars updated since whitelisting and asks you if you want to re-whitelist it or kick the player.

Trust Ranks (overridden by restricted avatars)

Automatically kicks anyone you have blocked (only on joining, not mid-game) regardless of being enabled just in case. You can unblock users remotely via VRChat's social page's search, so this is harmless and useful as a safeguard.

Automatically kick Non Optimized Users - Kicks users in unoptimized avatars.

Automatically detects if someone force joined, and alerts you to it (or automatically kicks if you please).
